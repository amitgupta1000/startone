            lessonContent.innerHTML = "Expressions are combinations of variables, numbers, and operators. Operators are symbols that tell the computer how to perform a calculation. For example, the operator `+` means addition, the operator `-` means subtraction, the operator `*` means multiplication, and the operator `/` means division.";

        case "Linear equations":
            lessonContent.innerHTML = "Linear equations are equations in which the highest power of any variable is 1. For example, the equation `x + 2 = 5` is a linear equation.";

The slope of a line tells you how much the line rises or falls for every unit it moves to the right. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.";
